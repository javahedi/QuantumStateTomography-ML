# Machine Learning for Quantum State Tomography üß™ü§ñ

## Overview  
This project explores the intersection of **machine learning** and **quantum information science** to enhance **Quantum State Tomography (QST)**. Using a **maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)** approach integrated with **graph neural networks (GNNs)**, the goal is to achieve more accurate and efficient quantum state reconstruction for multi-qubit systems.

## Features  
‚ú® **Maximum Likelihood Estimation**: Probabilistically reconstruct quantum states.  
‚ú® **Graph Neural Networks**: Model relational quantum data with cutting-edge GNN architectures.  
‚ú® **Single Jupyter Notebook**: Self-contained implementation for ease of understanding and experimentation.  
‚ú® **Improved Scalability**: Handle larger quantum systems with efficient computation.

## Getting Started  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:javahedi/QuantumStateTomography-ML.git 
   cd QuantumStateTomography-ML
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**  
   - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:  
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

   - Alternatively, install Jupyter Notebook and other dependencies directly:  
     ```bash
     pip install jupyterlab numpy matplotlib scipy tensorflow torch
     ```

3. **Launch the Jupyter Notebook**  
   Start the notebook server:  
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```
   Open `quantum_state_tomography.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.
